## Project Statement

### Project Title
Creating a Comprehensive Contributor Guide for WasmEdge Plug-ins

### Detailed Description
WasmEdge provides a flexible plug-in architecture that allows developers to add more functionalities to it and take advantage of its many integrations and distribution channels through extensive open-source partnerships. However, there is currently a lack of comprehensive tutorials and reference documentation for community members who want to contribute new plug-ins. By providing well-structured documentation, the process of developing plug-ins becomes more straightforward and accessible, ultimately benefiting every WasmEdge user through community contributions.

The scope of this project is to create a clear and comprehensive contributor guide for WasmEdge that will help new contributors develop plug-ins. This will involve reviewing the existing contributor documentation and creating new guides and references for the C, C++, and Rust plug-in SDKs.

This WasmEdge project will:
- Review the existing contributor documentation and develop a new outline for the contributor guide.
- Create new WasmEdge plug-in contributor guides in C, C++, and Rust.
- Update the docs on the new Docusaurus-based site wasmedge.org/docs/.

The following topics will be covered in the new WasmEdge plug-in contributor guide:
- Architectural overview
- Getting started with contributing
- Building WasmEdge
- Testing WasmEdge
- Fuzzing
- Building a plug-in
- Reporting an issue
- Proposing a feature request

By providing well-structured documentation, the process of developing plug-ins becomes more straightforward and accessible, ultimately benefiting every WasmEdge user through community contributions.

## Planning

To ensure the success of this project, I have devised a general plan that outlines the steps to overcome potential challenges and achieve project objectives. The plan covers the following aspects: 

 1. **Understanding the Existing Documentation:** The first step of the plan is to gain a deep understanding of the existing WasmEdge plug-in documentation. This will involve reviewing the current documentation, understanding its strengths and weaknesses, and identifying gaps in the documentation that need to be addressed. Additionally, I will need to discuss with mentors and community members to ensure I have a full understanding of the WasmEdge plug-in architecture and SDKs. 

 2. **Developing an Outline for the Contributor Guide:** Once I have a
    thorough understanding of the current documentation and the WasmEdge
    plug-in architecture, I will develop a comprehensive outline for the
    contributor guide. The outline will include all the essential
    sections and topics, such as architectural overview, getting started
    with contributing, building and testing WasmEdge, building a
    plug-in, and reporting an issue or feature request. The outline will
    serve as a guide for the rest of the project, ensuring all essential
    content is covered.

 3. **Creating New WasmEdge Plug-In Contributor Guides:** With the outline
    in place, I will start creating new guides and references for the C,
    C++, and Rust plug-in SDKs. These guides will be detailed and easy
    to follow, covering essential topics like SDK installation,
    developing and testing a sample plug-in, and submitting a pull
    request to the WasmEdge GitHub repository. I will ensure that the
    new guides are comprehensive, including all the necessary
    information to develop WasmEdge plug-ins, reducing the learning
    curve for new contributors.

 4. **Updating the Documentation on the New Docusaurus-Based Site:** Once the new contributor guides are created, I will update the
    documentation on the new Docusaurus-based site wasmedge.org/docs/.
    This will include integrating the new contributor guide, creating
    new pages for the updated plug-in SDK documentation, and ensuring
    that the site's structure is consistent and user-friendly. The
    updated documentation will provide a comprehensive resource for the
    community, enabling more developers to contribute to the WasmEdge
    project.

 5. **Review and Feedback Phase:** The final phase of the plan will involve
    reviewing and incorporating feedback from mentors and the community.
    I will make revisions where necessary and ensure that everything is
    up to date before submitting the final deliverables. This phase will
    ensure that the documentation is of high quality, meets the needs of
    the community, and is a valuable resource for new contributors.

 6. **Communication with Mentors and Community:** Throughout the project, I
    will maintain open communication channels with mentors and the
    community. I will provide regular updates on the progress of the
    project, seek feedback, and clarify any issues or questions. This
    will ensure that the project is on track and aligned with the needs
    of the WasmEdge community.

 7. **Time Management:** To ensure that the project is completed within the
    allocated timeline, I will develop a detailed schedule that breaks
    down the project into smaller tasks with specific timelines. This
    will help me to stay on track and ensure that all deliverables are
    completed on time."

### Proposed Timeline
The following is a proposed timeline for this project:

- Week 1: Information Gathering and Reviewing Existing Documentation
During the first week, I will gather information about the WasmEdge project, review the existing documentation, and discuss with mentors to understand the plug-in system's architectural design.

- Week 2-3: Developing the Outline for the Contributor Guide
In this phase, I will develop a comprehensive outline for the contributor guide. This will include the various sections and topics to cover in the guide, such as an architectural overview, getting started with contributing, building and testing WasmEdge, building a plug-in, and reporting an issue or feature request. The outline will serve as a guide for the rest of the project and ensure that all essential content is covered.

- Week 4-6: Creating New WasmEdge Plug-In Contributor Guides
This phase will involve creating new guides and references for the C, C++, and Rust plug-in SDKs. Each guide will cover essential topics like SDK installation, developing and testing a sample plug-in, and submitting a pull request to the WasmEdge GitHub repository. The guides will be detailed and easy to follow, ensuring that new contributors can start developing WasmEdge plug-ins without facing any issues.

- Week 7-8: Updating the Docs on the New Docusaurus-Based Site
In this phase, I will update the documentation on the new Docusaurus-based site wasmedge.org/docs/. This will include integrating the new contributor guide, creating new pages for the updated plug-in SDK documentation, and ensuring that the site's structure is consistent and user-friendly.

- Week 9-10: Review and Feedback Phase
In this final phase, I will incorporate feedback from mentors and the community, making revisions where necessary. I will also perform final reviews of the documentation and ensure that everything is up to date before submitting the final deliverables.

### Conclusion 

I believe that the proposed project will benefit the WasmEdge community by making it easier for  new contributors to develop plug-ins and add features to the project. The documentation created as part of this project will be a valuable resource for the community and will enable the growth of WasmEdge's plugin ecosystem. I have the necessary technical writing skills and experience to undertake this project successfully and make it a success. I look forward to working with the WasmEdge organization and contributing to the success of the project.
